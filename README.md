# 🧠 My Own AI — Intelligent Code Generator

Welcome to **My Own AI**, a cutting-edge project focused on building an AI-powered code generator with seamless GitHub integration. Our goal is to create a smart, adaptive platform that understands your development needs and delivers clean, efficient code — fast.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository is the foundation of a custom AI solution designed to:

- Generate high-quality code using LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Integrate directly with GitHub for streamlined workflows
- Learn and adapt through custom training flows
- Support modern development stacks with Python 3.12 and FastAPI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12** — Latest features and performance improvements
- **FastAPI** — High-performance web framework for building APIs
- **DeepSeek API** — Advanced LLM capabilities for code generation
- **GitHub Integration** — Automate commits, pull requests, and versioning

## 🧬 Learning Flow

We're building a robust learning pipeline to fine-tune our LLMs based on:

- Real-world coding patterns
- Repository structure and context
- Developer feedback and corrections

This allows our AI to evolve continuously and generate code that aligns with your project's architecture and standards.

## 📦 Features (In Progress)

- ✅ GitHub OAuth and repo access
- ✅ Prompt-based code generation
- 🔄 Context-aware suggestions
- 🔄 Auto-documentation and testing
- 🔄 Feedback loop for model refinement

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you're improving prompts, refining the learning flow, or enhancing GitHub integration — your input helps shape the future of intelligent development.
